We are making an Ontology with semantic triples. This will represent a software architecture. 
Read the text and respond with triples relating to these types of information:

The main entity class we care about is Component.
The main relations we are representing are:

ComponentId isA Component
ComponentId calls ComponentId
ComponentId partOf ComponentId

The main components of a Kubernetes cluster include:
Nodes: Nodes are VMs or physical servers that host containerized applications. Each node in a cluster can run one or more application instance. There can be as few as one node, however, a typical Kubernetes cluster will have several nodes (and deployments with hundreds or more nodes are not uncommon).
Image Registry: Container images are kept in the registry and transferred to nodes by the control plane for execution in container pods.
Pods: Pods are where containerized applications run. They can include one or more containers and are the smallest unit of deployment for applications in a Kubernetes cluster.

Gartnerâ€™s Container Best Practices suggest a platform strategy that considers security, governance, monitoring, storage, networking, container lifecycle management and orchestration like Kubernetes.

Here are some best practices for architecting Kubernetes clusters:

Ensure you have updated to the latest Kubernetes version (1.18 as of this writing).
Invest up-front in training for developer and operations teams.
Establish governance enterprise-wide. Ensure tools and vendors are aligned and integrated with Kubernetes orchestration.
Enhance security by integrating image-scanning processes as part of your CI/CD process, scanning during build and run phases. Open-source code pulled from a Github repository should always be considered suspect.
Adopt role-based access control (RBAC) across the cluster. Least privilege, zero-trust models should be the standard.
Further secure containers by using only non-root users and making the file system read-only.
